Operational Design Domain (Speed, road type, country, Environment, Road conditions, etc.)/ Boundary conditions/ Main conditions for Minimum risk manoeuvres and transition demands … This document clarifies derivation process to define conditions under which Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) shall avoid a collision. Conditions under which ALKS shall avoid a collision are determined by a general simulation program with following attentive human driver performance model and related parameters in the traffic critical disturbance scenarios.",
    "2.1.: ‘Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS)’ for low speed application is a system which is activated by the driver and which keeps the vehicle within its lane for travelling speed of 60 km/h or less by controlling the lateral and longitudinal movements of the vehicle for extended periods without the need for further driver input.\nWithin this Regulation, ALKS is also referred to as ‘\n               the system\n               ’. ‘The system’ means a ‘Higher-Level Electronic Control’ system and its electronic control system(s) that provide the automated driving function. This also includes any transmission links to or from other systems that are outside the scope of this Regulation that acts on the automated lane keeping function. Main automated Driving Functions (functional architecture, environmental perception). … Traffic disturbance critical scenarios are those which have conditions under which ALKS may not be able to avoid a collision. ‘Time to Collision’ (TTC) means the value of time obtained by dividing the longitudinal distance (in the direction of travel of the subject vehicle) between the subject vehicle and the target by the longitudinal relative speed of the subject vehicle and the target, at any instant in time",

Vehicle-internal …",
    "2.2.: ‘Transition demand’ is a logical and intuitive procedure to transfer the Dynamic Driving Task (DDT) from the system (automated control) to the human driver (manual control). This request is given from the system to the human driver. ‘Safety Concept’ is a description of the measures designed into the system, for example within the electronic units, so that the vehicle operates in such a way that it is free of unreasonable safety risks to the driver, passengers and other road users under faults and non-fault conditions. The possibility of a fallback to partial operation or even to a back-up system for vital vehicle functions shall be a part of the safety concept. Following three are traffic critical scenarios:\n(a)\nCut-in: the ‘other vehicle’ suddenly merges in front of the ‘ego vehicle’;\n(b)\nCut-out: the ‘other vehicle’ suddenly exits the lane of the ‘ego vehicle’;\n(c)\nDeceleration: the ‘other vehicle’ suddenly decelerates in front of the ‘ego vehicle’; ‘Offset’ means the distance between the vehicle’s and the respective target’s longitudinal median plane in driving direction, measured on the ground, normalized by the half the vehicle width excluding devices for indirect vision and corrected by adding 50 per cent.",

    "2.11.2.: ‘Failure mode’ is the operation status of the system in which the system operates with an ALKS failure.",
    "2.11.3.: A ‘severe ALKS failure’ is a failure specific to the operation of the ALKS that affects the safe operation of the system when in failure mode with a very low probability of occurrence such as generally used for essential components as e.g. an electronic control unit. Single sensor failures are only considered as such when accompanied by another influence affecting the safe operation of the system.",
    "2.11.4.: A ‘severe vehicle failure’ is any failure of the vehicle (e.g. electrical, mechanical) that affects the ability of the ALKS to perform the DDT and would also affect the manual operation of the vehicle (e.g. loss of power supply, failure of the braking system, sudden loss of tyre pressure).",
    "2.12.: ‘Self-check’ means an integrated function which checks for any system failure and for the detection range of the sensing system on a continuous basis. ‘Functional safety’: absence of unreasonable risks under the occurrence of hazards caused by a malfunctioning behaviour of electric/electronic systems (safety hazards resulting from system faults).",

    "2.16.: ‘Lifetime of the system’ is the period of time during which the ALKS system is available, as a function, on the vehicle. ‘Unreasonable risk’ means the overall level of risk for the driver, vehicle occupants and other road users which is increased compared to a competently and carefully driven manual vehicle.",
